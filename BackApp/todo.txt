The following is a list of the most urgent issues in the project:

	1)	Method BackupControl.retreiveSchedules() should handle the following cases:
			- Schedule cannot be reached.
			- Backups are found for documents that are no longer tracked by the system.

	2)	Method  Schedule.removeMasterFile() should handle options dealing with backup copies of the master files to be removed.

	3)	BackupControl needs methods to handle schedule update operations. 
	
	4)  Needs to handle filers and documents that do not have a corresponding local filer (so that
		if the original local database is compromised for some reason the backups can be restored using a
		fresh instance of the app). 
	
	5) Handle exceptions!


The following is a list of future nice-haves features for the project:

	1) A GUI.

	2) Security: 
			- Cryptographic module that secures backups.
			- Password access.
			
	3) Ability to save to online storage facility, eg. Mega or Amazon S3.
